# git-branch-kit

A CLI tool to simplify Git branch operations

Say goodbye to branch name typos ðŸ‘‹

## Installation

```sh
npm i -g git-branch-kit
```

## Recommended Settings

To customize the behavior of `git-branch-kit`, configure your `.gitconfig` as follows:

```ini
[git-branch-kit]
    checkout = checkout
    delete = delete
```

This configuration allows you to control the commands dynamically. For example:
- If `checkout` is defined, the `checkout` command will be available.
- If `delete` is defined, the `delete` command will be available.

Run the following commands to apply the recommended settings:

```sh
git config --global git-branch-kit.checkout checkout
git config --global git-branch-kit.delete delete
```

You can check the current settings with:

```sh
git config --get git-branch-kit.checkout
git config --get git-branch-kit.delete
```

## Commands

You can also check these commands by running `git-branch-kit -h`.

### Version

Display the current version of `git-branch-kit`:

```sh
git-branch-kit -v
```

or

```sh
git-branch-kit --version
```

### Checkout

Switch to a different branch interactively, similar to:

```sh
git checkout <branch>
```

Usage:

```sh
git-branch-kit checkout
```

### Delete

Delete one or more branches interactively, with an option for force deletion, similar to:

```sh
git branch -D <branch>
```

Usage:

```sh

```
